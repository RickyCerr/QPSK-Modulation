To run this code, simply press the 'run button'. You can adjust the bit stream length as needed. It is the first line and the variable is called 'sequence_len'.

There are two MAIN folders:
1) Using Built-in FFT and my Sliding Window
2) Using my FFT and Overlap-Save

These two folders contain SEVERAL different versions of the code. All versions contain Modules 1-3.

1) QPSK_Master_0p1noise - This file does not perform performance evaluation. It retrives the two input signals based on adding noise with a gain of 0.1. Plots only from Module 3.
  
2) QPSK_Master_ALL_plots_const_SNR - This file contains all the plot OUTPUTS from Modules 1-3. It DOES NOT itterate through different signal-to-noise ratios. It only runs once with SNR set to 0 (this can be manually changed). Takes some time to run since there are a lot of plots. But the plots perfectly visualize every step.

3) QPSK_Master_ALL_plots_var_SNR - This file contains all the plot OUTPUTS from Modules 1-3. It DOES itterate through different signal-to-noise ratios. It runs the entire program 3 times, changing the SNR from 0 to 5 to 10. Takes even more time to run since there are a lot of plots AND it loops 3 times. 

4) QPSK_Master_PART3_plots_const_SNR - This file only contains the plot OUTPUTS from Module 3. It DOES NOT itterate through different signal-to-noise ratios. It only runs once with SNR set to 0 (this can be manually changed). Takes less time to run since there are less plots and it doesn't loop.

5) QPSK_Master_PART3_plots_var_SNR - This file only contains the plot OUTPUTS from Module 3. It DOES itterate through different signal-to-noise ratios. It runs the entire program 3 times, changing the SNR from 0 to 5 to 10. Takes less time to run since there are less plots but it does loop.

6) QPSK_Master_NO_plots_var_SNR - This file conatins NO PLOTS. It DOES itterate through different signal-to-noise ratios. It runs the entire program 3 times, changing the SNR from 0 to 5 to 10. Takes the least time to run since there are no plots. This is mainly to show the performance evaluation efficiently.

These files are all their own main files, i.e they don't need any supporting input/variable files. They can be ran completely independently.

The two folders contain the same versions but one uses the given FFT/iFFT and my sliding window. The other uses my own DFT design and overlap-save.
